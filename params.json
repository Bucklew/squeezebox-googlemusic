{"name":"Squeezebox-googlemusic","tagline":"Squeezebox (Logitech Media Server) Plug-in for Google Play Music","body":"squeezebox-googlemusic\r\n======================\r\n\r\n[![Travis CI build status](https://travis-ci.org/hechtus/squeezebox-googlemusic.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hechtus/squeezebox-googlemusic)\r\n\r\nThis is a [Squeezebox](http://www.mysqueezebox.com/) (Logitech Media\r\nServer) Plug-in for playing music from your [Google Play\r\nMusic](https://play.google.com/music/) library and All Access. It is\r\nbased on the Python [Unofficial Google Play Music\r\nAPI](http://unofficial-google-music-api.readthedocs.org/) and the\r\nability of inlining Python in Perl programs.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThis installation procedure will only work on Linux based systems. At\r\nthe moment I do not know if this will ever work on Windows or Mac\r\nOS. Please let me know if you found a way to get this plugin running\r\non non-Linux systems to extend this How-to.\r\n\r\n1. You will need a Google account and some music and/or playlists in\r\n   your library. If you want to use Google Music All Access features\r\n   you will need a subscription to this service.\r\n\r\n1. Install Python and [Python pip](http://www.pip-installer.org).\r\n\r\n1. Install the [Unofficial Google Play Music\r\n   API](https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API>)\r\n   by running:\r\n\r\n         sudo pip install gmusicapi\r\n         \r\n   **Note**: You will need at least version 3.1.0 of gmusicapi.\r\n\r\n1. To be able to build the Perl package Inline::Python (see below) you\r\n   will need the Python developer package. The name of the package and\r\n   the way how to install it depends on your Linux distribution. On\r\n   **Debian** based systems you will have to do:\r\n\r\n         sudo apt-get install python-dev\r\n\r\n   On **redhat** systems do:\r\n\r\n         sudo yum install python-devel\r\n\r\n1. Install the Perl CPAN package\r\n   [Inline](http://search.cpan.org/~ingy/Inline/) and\r\n   [Inline::Python](http://search.cpan.org/~nine/Inline-Python/) by\r\n   running:\r\n\r\n         sudo cpan App::cpanminus\r\n         sudo cpanm --notest Inline\r\n         sudo cpanm --notest Inline::Python\r\n\r\n1. To install the plugin, add the repository URL\r\n   http://hechtus.github.io/squeezebox-googlemusic/repository/repo.xml\r\n   to your squeezebox plugin settings page.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n1. Go to the plug-in settings page and set your Google username and\r\n   password for the Google Music plug-in.\r\n\r\n1. The mobile device ID is a 16-digit hexadecimal string (without the\r\n   '0x' prefix) identifying the Android or iOS device you must already\r\n   have registered for Google Play Music. On Android you can obtain\r\n   this ID by dialing `*#*#8255#*#*` on your phone (see the aid) or\r\n   using this\r\n   [App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evozi.deviceid)\r\n   (see the Google Service Framework ID Key). You may also use the\r\n   script `mobile_devices.py` to list all registered devices. If your\r\n   Android or iOS device is already registered, you may leave the\r\n   field `Mobile Device ID` empty. It will be filled in automatically\r\n   after setting the username and password.\r\n\r\n   **Note**: A registered PC MAC address will not work as a mobile\r\n     device ID.\r\n\r\n1. Enable All Access if you have an All Access subscription.\r\n\r\n1. You will find the plug-in in the 'My Apps' section of the\r\n   squeezebox menu.\r\n \r\nProject resources\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n* [Source code](https://github.com/hechtus/squeezebox-googlemusic)\r\n* [Issue tracker](https://github.com/hechtus/squeezebox-googlemusic/issues)\r\n* [Current development snapshot](https://github.com/hechtus/squeezebox-googlemusic/archive/master.zip)\r\n\r\nToDo\r\n----\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to your help.
