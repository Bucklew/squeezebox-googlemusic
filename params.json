It is based on the\r\nPython [Unofficial Google Play Music\r\nAPI](http://unofficial-google-music-api.readthedocs.org/) and the\r\nability of inlining Python in Perl programs.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n1. You will need a Google account and some music and/or playlists in\r\n   your library. If you want to use Google Music All Access features\r\n   you will need a subscription to this service.\r\n\r\n2. Install Python and the [Unofficial Google Play Music\r\n   API](https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API>) by\r\n   running:\r\n\r\n         sudo pip install gmusicapi\r\n         \r\n   **Note**: For 'All Access' functionality you need at least version\r\n   3.0.0 of gmusicapi.\r\n\r\n3. Install the Perl CPAN [Inline](http://search.cpan.org/~ingy/Inline/)\r\n   package and\r\n   [Inline::Python](http://search.cpan.org/~nine/Inline-Python/) by\r\n   running:\r\n\r\n         sudo cpan App::cpanminus\r\n         sudo cpanm Inline\r\n         sudo cpanm Inline::Python\r\n\r\n4. To install the plugin, add this repository URL\r\n   http://hechtus.github.io/squeezebox-googlemusic/repository/repo.xml\r\n   to your squeezebox plugin settings page.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n1. Go to the plug-in settings page and set your Google username and\r\n   password for the Google Music plug-in.\r\n\r\n2. The mobile device ID is a 16-digit hexadecimal string (without the\r\n   '0x' prefix) identifying the Android device you must already have\r\n   registered for Google Play Music. You can obtain this ID by dialing\r\n   `*#*#8255#*#*` on your phone (see the aid) or using this\r\n   [App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evozi.deviceid)\r\n   (see the Google Service Framework ID Key). You may also use the\r\n   script `mobile_devices.py` to list all registered devices. If your\r\n   Android device is already registered, you should leave the field\r\n   `Mobile Device ID` empty. It will be filled in automatically after\r\n   setting the username and password.\r\n\r\n3. Enable All Access if you want.\r\n\r\n4. You will find the plug-in in the 'My Apps' section of the\r\n   squeezebox menu.\r\n \r\nProject resources\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n* [Source code](https://github.com/hechtus/squeezebox-googlemusic)\r\n* [Issue tracker](https://github.com/hechtus/squeezebox-googlemusic/issues)\r\n* [Current development snapshot](https://github.com/hechtus/squeezebox-googlemusic/archive/master.zip)\r\n\r\nToDo\r\n----\r\n\r\nThere are still lots of things to do.
